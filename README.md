# LexiGo

**LexiGo** is a machine learning model that translates spoken English into German. What truly distinguishes LexiGo from other translation software is its adaptability; it recognizes patterns in workplace conversations and provides tailored translations based on the specific topic of discussion.

Due to hardware limitations, I was only able to train the model on German, and I could not extend it to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, I encourage you to fine-tune the model to suit your specific needs, and I hope it proves to be a valuable resource for your projects.

## Important Notes:
1. **Ensure you have a GPU-enabled PC** for optimal performance.
2. I assume that your presence here indicates a fundamental understanding of building simple machine learning models. Therefore, I have omitted the exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps to maintain focus. The provided code is straightforward, and you are encouraged to conduct your own EDA and fine-tuning to better fit your specific tasks.
3. In the event of errors, please update your libraries and packages. Note that I utilized a pre-existing model from Hugging Face, specifically **T5-small**, which I fine-tuned for this particular application. For more accurate results, I recommend applying the same process to a larger T5 model.
4. Code is constantly evolving, so please ensure that you are using the latest versions of libraries when running this code. As of today, **Tuesday, November 5th, 2024, 8:41 AM**, the model works flawlessly.
5. The results folder may be absent; however, when you run the code, both a **results** and **logs** folder will be created. My folders are missing due to a system crash at that point.

I sincerely hope this project meets your expectations and that you find value in this endeavor.

Stay safe, and have a wonderful day ahead! ðŸŒŸ
